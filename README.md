# Non-parametrix-estimators-of-scaled-cash-flows
 This repository contains the code and the simulated data used for the numerical example in the Chapter: "Non-parametrix estimators of scaled cash flows" in the Thesis:"Non_Markov modeling in life insurance"
 The folder "Reserve estimation" includes the code and data needed for reserve comparisons in the numerical simulations. To replicate the results, download the folder and execute the script titled "plotting the reserves version without scaled.R". You can choose the specific data set to load by adjusting the simulated data selection within the script.
 The folder "scaled transition rates estimation" contains the code and data required for comparing the estimation of scaled transition rates. To replicate the results, download the folder and execute the script titled "comparison of transition probabilities.R". Note that the data itself is not uploaded, as the estimator calculations rely on stochastic variable draws, which vary based on the random seed and previously simulated data.
